Usage Notes:
 
The  default output format is a somewhat human-readable representation of the
changes.
 
The -e, -E, -x, -X (and corresponding long) options cause an ed script to be
output instead of the default.
 
Finally, the -m (--merge) option causes diff3 to do the merge internally and
output the actual merged file. For unusual input, this is more robust than
using ed.
 
If  a  FILE is '-', read standard input.  Exit status is 0 if successful, 1 if
conflicts, 2 if trouble.
