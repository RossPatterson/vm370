Usage Notes:
 
1. This is a straight port of the GNU utility the command format is UNIX style
   with the options before the file names.
 
2. There are no folders or directories in CMS therefore some of the options are
   non-functional.
 
3. UNIX style ">" I/O re-direction does not work. To write the output to a
   file issue a FILEDEF for "SYSTERM" before calling the command
 
4. Enter, "DIFF --help" for details of the options.
