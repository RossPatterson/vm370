Options:-
 
BBCopy=<Yes|no> The BBCOPY option specifies how blocks containing errors are
       No       to be handled.  Specify NO to cause blocks that may contain
                errors to be skipped by MAP=DATA, MAP=ALTDATA, and OUTPUT
                option processing.  The default is YES.
 
BBLimit=n       The BBLIMIT option specifies the number of input errors that
                will be allowed.  TapeMap execution will terminate when the
                specified number of recoverable errors have occurred.  The
                default is 32.  Note that TapeMap may terminate before this
                limit is reached if certain serious errors occur.
 
BLKsize=n       The BLKSIZE option is used to specify the block size of the
                input and output files for OUTPUT option processing.  If no
                value is specified, the value from the file label or the
                actual block size will be used.
 
Blocks=<n|All|Actual|5>
                The BLOCKS option is used in conjunction with the MAP and
                OUTPUT options to specify the number of blocks from each file
                to be processed.  Specify ALL or ACTUAL to process all blocks.
                The default value is 5.
 
BLP             The BLP option will bypass label processing.  This will cause
                labels to be treated as data files and the tape to be treated
                as unlabeled.
 
CC=<None|Yes|Ansi|Asa|Ibm|M>
                The CC option specifies whether or not input records are
                assumed to contain carriage control characters when processed
                by the OUTPUT option.  YES, ANSI, and ASA all indicate that
                ANSI standard control characters are present.  IBM and M
                indicate that IBM machine codes are present.  The default is
                taken from the tape labels for labeled tapes, otherwise the
                default is NONE.
 
Code=Ebcdic|Ascii
                The CODE option specifies the character set used when MAP=DATA
                or MAP=ALTDATA is specified.  The default is EBCDIC unless the
                tape contains ANS labels.
 
Data=<n|All|Actual|80>
                The DATA option is used in conjunction with the MAP=DATA and
                MAP=ALTDATA options to limit the number of bytes of data
                    ted from each block.  Specify ALL or ACTUAL to print all
                the data in the blocks.  The default value is 80.
 
DATAFrom=n      The DATAFROM (or DFROM) option is used in conjunction with the
DFrom           MAP=DATA and MAP=ALTDATA options to specify a starting point
                for data printing within each block.  The default value is 0
                (the start of the block).
 
 
DFrom=n         The DFROM option is the same as DATAFROM (described above).
 
DIsk            The DISK option will cause the printed output to be directed
                to a disk file named TAPEMAP LISTING.  The filemode is deter-
(CMS Only)      mined by the OUTFMODE option.  This option is meaningful only
                under CMS.
 
Eot             The EOT option will cause processing to stop when the logical
                end-of-tape is reached.  This is usually indicated by two
                consecutive tape marks with no intervening data blocks (an
                empty file).  EOT is the default.
 
FOR=n           The FOR option specifies the number of files to be processed
                by the MAP and OUTPUT options.  There is no default limit.
                This option should be specified after the FROM option if both
                are used.
 
From=n          The FROM option specifies the first file on the tape to be
                processed by the MAP and OUTPUT options.  The default is 1,
                the first file.
 
LEAVE           The LEAVE option causes the tape to be left at the end (or
                wherever mapping stops) when TapeMap ends.  The default is
                REWIND.  The NOREWIND option affects tape positioning before
                mapping.  REWIND and LEAVE affect the position after mapping.
 
LINecount=n     The LINECOUNT option specifies the number of data lines on
                each page of output.  The number of lines printed on each page
                is the LINECOUNT value plus five heading lines.  The default
                is 55.
 
LOng            The LONG option causes extended information to be listed from
                tape labels.  The additional information includes the gener-
                ation number and version, the name of the job that created the
                file, and tape drive and system identification.
 
LRecl=n         The LRECL option is used to specify the logical record length
                of the input and output files for OUTPUT option processing.
                If no value is specified, TapeMap will select a value based on
                any available label information, the BLKSIZE, and RECFM.
 
Map=<Labels|DSN|Files|Blocks|Data|Altdata>  r
                The MAP option is used to specify the type of printed map to
                be produced.  LABELS will cause only data from tape labels to
                be printed.  DSN is similar to LABELS, but will stop
                processing after the header of the last file to be processed
                when limited by the THRU or FOR option.  FILES will cause a
                summary of each file to be printed (this includes block size
                data, block counts, and an estimate of the length of each file
                in feet).  BLOCKS will cause a description of the data blocks
                to be printed.  DATA will cause data from the blocks to be
                printed in both hexadecimal and character forms. ALTDATA will
                cause data from the blocks to be printed in character form
                with sixty-four characters per line.  The number of blocks
                from each file printed is controlled by the BLOCKS option, and
                the number of bytes of data printed from each block is
                controlled by the DFROM and DATA options.  The default for IBM
                and ANS labeled tapes is LABELS.  FILES is the default for
                unlabeled tapes.
 
NODETail        The NODETAIL option will suppress the detailed listing of the
                contents of files in CMS TAPE or VMFPLC2 format.  DETAIL is
                the default.
 
NODIsk          The NODISK option will suppress the creation of the TAPEMAP
                LISTING disk file.  This is the default.  This option is
                 eaningful only under CMS.
 
NOEOT           The NOEOT option will cause processing to continue after the
                logical end-of-tape is encountered.  This may be useful for
                unlabeled tapes that do not follow the normal end-of-tape
                convention (two consecutive tape marks with no intervening
                data blocks).  This option should be used carefully and only
                when absolutely necessary.  The Operations Supervisor should
                be notified when a job using this option is submitted, since
                operator intervention may be required to prevent running the
                tape off the reel.  The THRU option can be used to specify the
                last file to be processed if the number of files actually on
                the tape is known.
 
NOPrint         The NOPRINT option will suppress spooled print output under
                CMS.  NOPRINT is the default under CMS.  SYSPRINT output under
(CMS Only)      OS can be suppressed by not supplying a SYSPRINT DD statement.
 
NOREWind        The NOREWIND option suppresses the initial rewind of the tape.
                When NOREWIND is specified mapping begins wherever the tape is
                positioned.  This means that the file counts and length
                estimates may be incorrect.  The NOREWIND option affects tape
                positioning before mapping.  REWIND and LEAVE affect the
                position after mapping.
 
NOTerminal      The NOTERM option will suppress console output under CMS.
                SYSTERM output under OS may be suppressed by not supplying a
(CMS Only)      SYSTERM DD statement.
 
NOType          NOTYPE is a synonym for NOTERMINAL.
 
OUTFmode=fm     The OUTFMODE option supplies the filemode for the disk output
                files created for the DISK and OUTPUT options under CMS.  A
                disk must be accessed at the specified mode.  The default is
(CMS Only)      A1.  This option is ignored under OS.
 
Output          The OUTPUT option will cause the data from the tape to be
                formatted and sent to SYSOUT (under OS) or to disk files named
                TAPEMAP FILEnnnn (under CMS).  The BLKSIZE, CC, LRECL, and
                RECFM options and label information (if available) are used to
                determine the output format.  BLKSIZE, CC, and RECFM should
                reflect the actual format of the input file or there may be
                undesirable results.  The filemode under CMS is determined by
                the OUTFMODE option.  Under OS, it will generally not be
                possible to OUTPUT more than one file from a tape unless the
                files are in the same format.  Use the FROM and THRU options
                to select a specific file or files.
 
Print           The PRINT option will cause printed output to be sent to
                SYSPRINT (under OS) or the spooled printer (under CMS).  PRINT
                is the default under OS if the SYSPRINT DD statement is
                present.
 
Recfm=<Auto|?|F|FB|V|VB|VBS|VS>
                The RECFM option specifies the input and output record format
                to be used with processing for the OUTPUT option.  AUTO (or ?)
                will cause TapeMap to determine the format from the label
                information (if present) or the data itself.  The default is
                AUTO.  Spanned records (VS and VBS) are not currently
                supported.
 
REWind          The REWIND option causes the tape to be rewound after it is
                mapped.  REWIND is the default; see also the LEAVE option.
                The NOREWIND option affects tape positioning before mapping.
                REWIND and LEAVE affect the position after mapping.
 
Short           The SHORT option will cause abbreviated data to be printed
                from tape labels.  This will include file number and name,
                format, and the creation and expiration dates.  SHORT is the
                default.  Specify LONG for additional information about each
                file.
 
TAPn            The TAPn option specifies the input tape unit when running
                under CMS.  The default is TAP1.
 
TErminal        The TERMINAL option will cause printed output to be directed
                to SYSTERM (under OS) or the console (under CMS).  TERMINAL is
                the default under CMS, and under OS if the SYSTERM DD
                statement is present.
 
Through=<n|Eot|End> n
                The THRU option specifies the number of the last file on the
                tape to be processed.  The default value EOT will cause all
                files to the logical end-of-tape to be processed.
 
TO=<n|Eot|End>  The TO option is used to specify a limit for the number of
                files processed.  The number of the last file processed will
                be one less than the TO option value.  The default value EOT
                will cause all files to the logical end-of-tape to be
                processed.
 
TYpe            TYPE is a synonym for TERMINAL.
 
Volume          The VOLUME (or VOLSER) option will cause only the tape
Volser          density, format, and volume name (if any) to be printed.
                Specifying this option will cause TapeMap to read only the
                first block on the tape.
